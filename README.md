# Flutter Project

This is a Flutter project for creating a mobile application. Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web.

## Working Behaviour
Our application provides a platform for donors and acceptors to connect and facilitate the donation of food. Through the platform, donors can easily post a description of the food they are able to donate and acceptors can search for nearby donors to receive the food. Once a connection is made, the donor and acceptor can communicate to complete the transaction. Additionally, acceptors can be notified when a donor adds a food donation or cash. To ensure the Halal status of food is verified, criteria have been set to verify the Halal status of food by sharing images and other details. Furthermore, Google Maps has been incorporated into the platform to ensure that donors and acceptors can track each other. By utilizing this approach, we aim to reduce hunger and surplus food wastage, and ultimately achieve the United Nations' goal of providing every person with access to the food they need.

## Summary
Our project seeks to address the global issue of zero hunger by leveraging the skills, resources and ideas of a global community of innovators. We have chosen a microservices architecture, with services written in Node.js and a user-friendly interface created with Flutter. Version control is managed with Github. By utilizing this approach, we aim to reduce hunger and surplus food wastage, and ultimately achieve the United Nations' goal of providing every person with access to the food they need.
